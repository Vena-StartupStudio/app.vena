=== MANUAL MIGRATION REQUIRED ===

The scheduler migration needs to be run manually in your Supabase dashboard.

Steps:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wlsezmbnzovkttjeiizr/sql/new
2. Copy the contents of supabase/migrations/0001_scheduler.sql
3. Paste it into the SQL editor
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration

After running the migration, you can run the seed script:
npm run seed

The migration will create:
- schedules table
- availability_windows table  
- bookings table
- Row Level Security policies
- attempt_booking function

console.log("Printing migration SQL for easy copying:");
console.log("=".repeat(50));

import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

try {
  const migrationPath = path.join(process.cwd(), "supabase", "migrations", "0001_scheduler.sql");
  const migrationSql = fs.readFileSync(migrationPath, "utf8");
  console.log(migrationSql);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Could not read migration file:", error);
}
